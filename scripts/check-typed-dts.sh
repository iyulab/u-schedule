# Fails when a generated TypeScript declaration does not describe what the
# binding returns:
#
#   1. an exported function whose return type is `any`
#   2. a type named in a signature or a field that the file never declares
#
# (1) is the reported harm: `as` is the only thing a consumer can write against
# `any`, and `as` is exactly the construct that silences a wrong assumption
# about a result's shape -- a renderer read a per-point boolean mask as an
# array of indices, compiled, shipped, and printed the same subgroup twelve
# times. (2) is how (1) comes back disguised: the declaration names a type that
# does not exist, because the struct behind it is missing its derive, and the
# consumer's build then fails on our file instead of on their mistake.
#
# This runs on the publish path, not only in CI: the two run side by side on
# the same push, so a check that lives only in CI cannot stop a publish.
