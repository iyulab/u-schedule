# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Maintained from 0.2.3 onward; earlier entries list release dates only (see git history).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- npm: expose the `./package.json` subpath in the `exports` map so tools
  that `require('<pkg>/package.json')` (license scanners, version
  reporters) keep working alongside the conditional exports introduced in
  the previous release (`ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- **npm packaging — Node-compatible entry.** The npm package previously
  shipped only the wasm-bindgen *bundler*-target output, whose static
  `.wasm` import fails on Node's CJS path (`tsx`/`ts-node` in non-ESM
  packages) with an opaque `SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token`.
  The package now additionally ships the *nodejs*-target CJS glue under
  `node/` and routes Node consumers to it via a conditional `exports`
  map (`node` → CJS with filesystem wasm loading, `default` → bundler
  ESM). `require()`, native ESM `import`, and CJS TS runners all work
  without loader hooks. A pre-publish smoke test (CJS `require` + ESM
  `import`) now guards this path in CI. Rust API unchanged.

### Changed

- `u-numflow` dependency `^0.2` → `^0.3` (compatible; 0.3.0 publishes the
  previously-unreleased `wasm` feature and input-validation hardening —
  no API used by this crate changed).


## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-12

### Changed — BREAKING (WASM)

- WASM input/config objects (`run_schedule`, `solve_jobshop` — including nested
  job, operation, and `ga_config` objects) now **reject unknown keys** with an
  explicit `unknown field` error instead of silently ignoring them
  (`serde(deny_unknown_fields)`). Remove any extra keys when upgrading.

### Changed

- Dependency: `u-metaheur` `^0.2` → `^0.3`.

### Fixed

- Latent test defect (wasm feature only): minimal jobshop GA test used
  population 4 with the default elite ratio, flooring to 0 elites, which
  `GaConfig::validate` rejects.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- WASM: dropped legacy `*_json` parameter-name suffixes — exported functions
  take native JS objects/arrays, and JSON-string arguments are now rejected
  early with a descriptive error.
